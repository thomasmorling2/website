Financial firms replaced aging mainframe based pricing\n        systems such as Quotron with the fast and reliable Stratus machines.\n         Times were good!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Thomas prospered along with Stratus and he married, moved to New Jersey\n        and had two kids.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Another technology that was catching interest on Wall Street was object\n        oriented programming.   \n      </p>\n      <p>\n        One of the first companies to embrace this new technology was NeXT\n        Computers, the UNIX-based workstation created by Steve Jobs when he was\n        fired from Apple.   Along with other innovations, NeXT delivered a\n        stunning visual environment and networking capability that enabled the\n        first Internet browser created by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in\n        Switzerland.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Thomas was recruited by NeXT to open a sales office in New York City.\n         Thomas grew that office to over 25 sales and technical support staff\n        and was responsible for half of NeXT’s overall global revenue in 1991.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        One fact that not many know is that the Unix kernel developed for NeXT\n        became OS/X when Steve returned back to Apple.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In 1996, Thomas joined a start-up consulting firm named Silicon Valley\n        Internet Partners (SVIP) created to bring expertise to the rapidly\n        growing online, ecommerce markets beginning to take shape.  Thomas sold\n        services to a wide variety of companies in financial services,\n        telecommunications, retail, and pharma sectors.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        One of the more interesting ventures was an online music service called\n        Sputnik, the first music service based on broadband Internet\n        connectivity in existence at the time.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        SVIP changed its name to Viant and was taken public by Goldman Sachs in\n        1999 raising $180M.  Unfortunately the company lost traction as the\n        market declined in the early 2000’s and Thomas moved on to independently\n        advise start-up firms and their VC investors on best practices for\n        business development in a startup environment.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Thomas worked with several early stage companies such as Global Logic, a\n        startup that became a leading offshore development firm, and VFinity, a\n        startup focused on digital asset management.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Thomas returned to California in 2009 and joined North Plains, a leading\n        provider of digital asset management software for Fortune 500\n        enterprises. Except for a two year stint at rival ADAM Software, Thomas\n        remained at North Plains until 2017.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Today Thomas lives in Topanga, California, enjoys hiking and cooking\n         and is looking for the next project!\n      </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default AboutPage\n","import React from \"react\"\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\"\nimport \"./header.css\"\n\nconst Header = () => {\n  return (\n    <header className=\"header\">\n      <h1>Thomas Morling</h1>\n      <nav>\n        <ul className=\"nav-list\">\n          <li>\n            <Link className=\"navItem\" to=\"/\">\n              Home\n            </Link>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <Link className=\"navItem\" to=\"/blog\">\n              Blog\n            </Link>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <Link className=\"navItem\" to=\"/about\">\n              About\n            </Link>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <Link className=\"navItem\" to=\"/contact\">\n              Contact\n            </Link>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </nav>\n    </header>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Header\n","/**\n * Layout component that queries for data\n * with Gatsby's StaticQuery component\n *\n * See: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/static-query/\n */\n\nimport React from \"react\"\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\"\nimport { StaticQuery, graphql } from \"gatsby\"\n\nimport Header from \"./header\"\nimport \"./layout.css\"\n\nconst Layout = ({ children }) => (\n  <StaticQuery\n    query={graphql`\n      query SiteTitleQuery {\n        site {\n          siteMetadata {\n            title\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    `}\n    render={data => (\n      <>\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <Header siteTitle={data.site.siteMetadata.title} />\n          <main>{children}</main>\n          <footer>\n            <br />© {new Date().getFullYear()}, Built with\n            {` `}\n            <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a>\n          </footer>\n        </div>\n      </>\n    )}\n  />\n)\n\nLayout.propTypes = {\n  children: PropTypes.node.isRequired,\n}\n\nexport default Layout\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
