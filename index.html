        <h3>About Me</h3>
           
            <p>
              Thomas began his career working for a small semiconductor company in
              Silicon Valley named Siliconix.  The company held a job fair to recruit
              desperately needed engineers to fuel the explosive growth in an area
              known for peaches and almond orchards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though Thomas majored in Liberal Arts and Communications at
              Syracuse University, engineers were in such demand at that time that
              college graduates with non-technical degrees could be hired by passing a
              2 hour technical exam.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thomas passed the test and was hired as a junior engineer building
              prototypes of potential Siliconix products in 1978.  It was an exciting
              time in Silicon Valley!
            </p>
            <p>
              Intel Corp was also booming and growing.Thomas was hired to provide
              technical marketing support for Intel’s memory products division and was
              called upon to travel to Intel’s customers to present new products and
              support the sales team.
            </p>
            <p>
              He attracted the attention of the Sales Regional Manager from New York
              and was moved to New York City from California in 1981 to “try out”
              sales.
            </p>
            <p>
              It turned out that there wasn’t a big market for semiconductor chips in
              New York City but instead what was in demand was technology to support
              the booming, newly deregulated options and derivatives trading desks
              where securities needed to be “marked to market” in real time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thomas was hired by a small mini computer company called Stratus.  The
              computer was fast, flexible and fault tolerant and quickly became a hit
              on Wall Street. Financial firms replaced aging mainframe based pricing
              systems such as Quotron with the fast and reliable Stratus machines.
               Times were good!
            </p>
            <p>
              Thomas prospered along with Stratus and he married, moved to New Jersey
              and had two kids.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another technology that was catching interest on Wall Street was object
              oriented programming.   
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the first companies to embrace this new technology was NeXT
              Computers, the UNIX-based workstation created by Steve Jobs when he was
              fired from Apple.   Along with other innovations, NeXT delivered a
              stunning visual environment and networking capability that enabled the
              first Internet browser created by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in
              Switzerland.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thomas was recruited by NeXT to open a sales office in New York City.
               Thomas grew that office to over 25 sales and technical support staff
              and was responsible for half of NeXT’s overall global revenue in 1991.
            </p>
            <p>
              One fact that not many know is that the Unix kernel developed for NeXT
              became OS/X when Steve returned back to Apple.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1996, Thomas joined a start-up consulting firm named Silicon Valley
              Internet Partners (SVIP) created to bring expertise to the rapidly
              growing online, ecommerce markets beginning to take shape.  Thomas sold
              services to a wide variety of companies in financial services,
              telecommunications, retail, and pharma sectors.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the more interesting ventures was an online music service called
              Sputnik, the first music service based on broadband Internet
              connectivity in existence at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              SVIP changed its name to Viant and was taken public by Goldman Sachs in
              1999 raising $180M.  Unfortunately the company lost traction as the
              market declined in the early 2000’s and Thomas moved on to independently
              advise start-up firms and their VC investors on best practices for
              business development in a startup environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thomas worked with several early stage companies such as Global Logic, a
              startup that became a leading offshore development firm, and VFinity, a
              startup focused on digital asset management.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thomas returned to California in 2009 and joined North Plains, a leading
              provider of digital asset management software for Fortune 500
              enterprises. Except for a two year stint at rival ADAM Software, Thomas
              remained at North Plains until 2017.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today Thomas lives in Topanga, California, enjoys hiking and cooking
               and is looking for the next project!
